# Documentation

# Overview

_Trento_ is a comprehensive cloud-native, distributed monitoring solution.

It's made of three main components:

- Trento Agent
- Trento Runner
- Trento Web (current repository)

[Trento Agent](https://github.com/trento-project/agent) is a single background **process running in each host of the target** infrastructure the user desires to monitor.
[Trento Runner](https://github.com/trento-project/runner) is responsible for **running** the Trento configuration health checks\*\* among the installed Trento Agents.

_Trento Web_ is the **control plane of the Trento Platform**.
In cooperation with the Agents and the Runner it discovers, observes, monitors and checks the target SAP infrastructure.

See the [architecture document](https://github.com/trento-project/docs/blob/main/guides/architecture/trento-architecture.md) for additional details.

> Being the project in development, all of the above might be subject to change!

# Features

## SAP HANA HA Automated discovery

The central server integrates with the agents discoveries by **collecting** information about the target SAP infrastructure and then **detects** different kinds of scenarios and **reacts** accordingly.

See also [Trento Agent](https://github.com/trento-project/agent) for additional information.

## Reactive Control Plane

By leveraging modern approaches to software architecture and engineering and top-notch technologies we built a **reactive system** that provides **real-time** feedback about the **changes in the target** infrastructure.

Here's a non-comprehensive list of the capabilities provided by the bundled Web UI:

- Global Health Overview
- Hosts Overview and Detail
- Pacemaker Clusters Overview and Detail
- SAP Systems Overview and Detail
- HANA Databases Overview and Detail
- Checks Catalog

## Configuration validation

Trento is able to execute a variety of _configuration health checks_ (a.k.a. the _HA Config Checks_) among the installed Trento Agents.

- Pacemaker, Corosync, SBD, SAPHanaSR and other generic _SUSE Linux Enterprise for SAP Application_ OS settings
- Specific configuration audits for SAP HANA Scale-Up Performance-Optimized scenarios deployed on MS Azure cloud.

See [Trento Runner](https://github.com/trento-project/runner) for additional information.

## Monitoring

It is important in critical business systems to have access to relevant information about _how things are going_.
Currently, Trento provides basic integration with **Grafana** and **Prometheus**.

See [related documentation](./guides/monitoring/monitoring.md) for more information.

## Alerting

Alerting feature notifies the SAP Administrator about important updates in the Landscape being monitored/observed by Trento.

See [related documentation](./guides/alerting/alerting.md) for more information.

# Installation

_Trento_ is intended to run in many ways, depending on needs, and also the different components have their own requirements and constraints.

Please check the specific [Agent](https://github.com/trento-project/agent) and [Runner](https://github.com/trento-project/runner) documentation for respective details.

If you intend to install Trento on a k8s cluster, you may be interested in our [helm-charts](https://github.com/trento-project/helm-charts) repo for detailed instructions.

If otherwise you want to play around with the current repository, go ahead, [hack on the trento](./guides/development/hack_on_the_trento.md) and **have a lot of fun**!
