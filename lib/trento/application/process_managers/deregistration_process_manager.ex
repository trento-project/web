    The process manager is interested in HostRegistered which starts or joins an existing process
    manager for the host identified by a host_id field.
    The process manager is interested in HostDeregistered which stops a process manager for the host identified by host_id.

    We consider also the host rollup case, starting a process manager when the host rolled up arrived, so we identify a registered host
    without the HostRegistered event, because that event could be rolled up and then we have to consider also the rolled up host as registered.

    The process manager starts with a Deregistration request and stops when the host is fully deregistered.
