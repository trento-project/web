== Monitoring

Currently Trento provides a basic integration with
https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus[Prometheus] that gives realtime
information of the following metrics:

* Host CPU usage
* Host Memory usage

Current integration strategy: Custom charts Trento UI (_Host Details_).

In order for monitoring to properly work here’s the required environment
variables - `+PROMETHEUS_URL+` -> prometheus URL, should be accessible
from the web backend, it’s not mandatory to expose on the internet.

On a full Trento installation monitoring is enabled by default and the
configuration is handled by the helm-charts.
