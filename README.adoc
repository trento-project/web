_Trento_ is a bespoke, stand-alone web application, built by SUSE from
the ground up, to facilitate SAP operations, proactively preventing
infrastructural issues by diagnosing common configuration mistakes by
validating systems against SUSE best practices. +
It’s meant to complement link:https://www.suse.com/products/sles-for-sap/[SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server for SAP Applications] in helping IT organizations run
mission-critical enterprise software.

== Documentation

The documentation is available at
link:https://trento-project.io/web/[trento-project.io/web].

Swagger UI is available at
link:https://trento-project.io/web/swaggerui[trento-project.io/web/swaggerui].

== Overview

_Trento_ is a distributed system, and it consists of three main
components:

* link:https://github.com/trento-project/agent[Agent]: The background *edge
process* that runs on each host in the target infrastructure.
* link:https://github.com/trento-project/wanda[Wanda]: The *_checks_
orchestrator*, executing assertions on a target infrastructure using the
information collected by Trento Agents.
* link:https://github.com/trento-project/web[Web] (current repository): The
*web UI* and *control plane*, which works in conjunction with the Agents
and Wanda to *discover, observe, and validate* the target SAP
infrastructure.

=== Trento architecture

See the link:https://github.com/trento-project/docs/blob/main/content/architecture/trento-architecture.adoc[architecture document] for additional details.

== Features of Trento

=== SAP HANA HA Automated discovery

The central server integrates with the agents discoveries by
*collecting* information about the target SAP infrastructure and then
*detects* different kinds of scenarios and *reacts* accordingly.

See also link:https://github.com/trento-project/agent[Trento Agent] for
additional information.

=== Configuration validation

Trento is able to execute a variety of _configuration health checks_
(a.k.a. the _HA Config Checks_) among the installed Trento Agents.

* Pacemaker, Corosync, SBD, SAPHanaSR and other generic _SUSE Linux
Enterprise for SAP Application_ OS settings
* Specific configuration audits for SAP HANA Scale-Up
Performance-Optimized scenarios deployed on MS Azure cloud.

See link:https://github.com/trento-project/wanda[Trento Wanda] for additional
information.

=== Reactive Control Plane

By leveraging modern approaches to software architecture and engineering
and top-notch technologies, we built a *reactive system* that provides
*real-time* feedback about the *changes in the target* infrastructure.

Here’s a non-comprehensive list of the capabilities provided by the
link:https://github.com/trento-project/web[Trento Web] UI:

* Global Health Overview
* Hosts Overview and Detail
* Pacemaker Clusters Overview and Detail
* SAP Systems Overview and Detail
* HANA Databases Overview and Detail
* Checks Catalog

=== Monitoring

It is important in critical business systems to have access to relevant
information about _how things are going_. Currently, Trento provides
basic integration with *Prometheus*.

See xref:Monitoring/monitoring.adoc[related documentation] for
more information.

=== Alerting

Alerting feature notifies the SAP Administrator about important updates
in the Landscape being monitored/observed by Trento.

See xref:Alerting/alerting.adoc[related documentation] for more information.
